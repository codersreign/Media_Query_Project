                <h1 align=center>Albert Einstein</h1>
                <p>Albert Einstein was a German American scientist. He is best known for his theories on relativity and theories of matter and heat. Einstein is considered one of the greatest physicists of all time because he is thought to have changed the way one looks at the universe. <br>
                    It will be apt to mention here a famous quote by Einstein which portrays him as a great visionary. He said, “I do not know how the Third World War will be fought, but I can tell you what they will use in the Fourth-rocks!” He was thus, aware of the potent effects of the war. In his later years, he lobbied to stop nuclear testing and future bombs. <br>

                    On 17th April, 1955, Albert Einstein experienced internal bleeding and died at the ripe age of 76. He had taken along with him to the hospital, the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance, commemorating Israel’s seventh anniversary; but he did not live long enough to complete it. <br>

                    Einstein refused surgery and said : “I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share, it is time to go. I will do it elegantly”. He died in Princeton Hospital the next morning. Thus, his death proved to be an irreparable loss to the scientific community.
